<h1>Main Concepts</h1>
<b>The Way the Web Works</b>
<p>The world wide web is essentially a vast collection
of html documents dispersed among a myriad of computers and
communicated via <em>HTTP Request</em> from the user to a
<em>server</em>. The server then retrieves the appropriate
html document and returns it to the user's computer, wherein the 
<em>web browser</em> interprets the document and displays it 
as a web page on the user's screen.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is shorthand for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML
documents comprise the majority of the content on the web. HTML 
documents contain <em>text content</em>, "what you see" and 
<em>markup</em>, "how it looks".

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are composed of HTML <b>elements</b>. When 
writing html, the type of each element is conveyed to the browser 
by using HTML <b>tags</b>.

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>This is to say, computers are stupid because they are only 
able to interpret instructions literally. Therefore, if upon 
writing a program a small mistake is made, a very big problem 
may present within the program at runtime.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block 
elements each occupy a full line and encapsulate their 
content with an 'invisible box', whereas inline elements only 
occupy a fraction of a line per element, to the extent that the 
remainder of space in such line is sufficient.
